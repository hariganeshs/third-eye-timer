# Project Summary - Third Eye Timer

## Project Status: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

**Repository**: https://github.com/hariganeshs/third-eye-timer  
**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**Status**: Successfully deployed to GitHub

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. All Critical Issues Fixed
- Timer Pause/Resume: Fixed critical bug where timer restarted from beginning
- UI Layout: Resolved button overlapping with ad banners
- 16KB Memory Support: Added Android 15+ compatibility
- GitHub Repository: Successfully created and pushed clean version

### 2. Production-Ready App
- Version: 1.0.5 (version code 6)
- Build: Successfully creates APK and AAB files
- Signing: Release keystore configured
- Compliance: 16KB memory page support enabled

### 3. Repository Management
- Original Size: 40.24 MiB (caused GitHub push failures)
- Final Size: 107.70 KiB (clean, successful)
- Approach: Clean repository with source code only

## Critical Warnings for Future Agents

1. NEVER add large media files directly to Git - Repository will break again
2. Timer pause/resume logic MUST work correctly - Critical functionality
3. 16KB memory page support is REQUIRED - Dont remove this configuration
4. Use clean repository approach for any major changes

## Key Files & Locations

- MainActivity.kt: Timer logic, UI handling
- activity_main.xml: Main UI layout
- build.gradle.kts: Build configuration
- .gitignore: Git ignore rules

## Essential Commands

# Build
./gradlew assembleDebug
./gradlew assembleRelease
./gradlew bundleRelease

# Git (if adding large files later)
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.png" "*.wav" "*.mp3"

## Testing Requirements

Critical Test Cases:
1. Timer: Start → Pause → Resume (should continue, not restart)
2. UI: Check buttons dont overlap with ads
3. Build: Verify app compiles successfully

## Success Metrics

- GitHub Repository: Successfully created and pushed
- App Functionality: All critical bugs fixed
- Build Process: APK and AAB generation working
- Documentation: Comprehensive guides created
- Future-Proofing: Clean repository structure established
